./compile_chesroms_marcc.sh

Update the makefile file

Update the lnetcdf and lnetcdff

update nc and nf include dir

Check to see if I can add ARPACK and mct, the source code is in HAO/Lib on the linux box

.in files are in user/external

vi ./COMF/ohms/CHESROMS/sorc/ROMS/testing/CBAY/chesroms.in
Old version of chesroms came with .in files, can we edit them to fit for the new code?
