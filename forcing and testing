The old and new bathymetry are slightly different
 run year 1999 as an example:

 chesroms_Nz20.in is the control file for 20 level run, you should modify it
 accordingly for your run, for example, NtileI*NtileJ should equal the np value
 when you run it in parallel using MPI

 chesroms_Nz30.in is the control file for 30 level run, you should modify it
 accordingly for your run


    1) 20 level run

       > mpiexec -np 8 $CHESROMS_BIN/ChesROMS_3_0_MPI.exe chesroms_Nz20


    2) 30 level run

       > mpiexec -np 8 $CHESROMS_BIN/ChesROMS_3_0_MPI.exe chesrms_Nz30.in

    3) results are at ../output

 If you want to run it in not using MPI but using sequential code, please go to ..../ohms/sorc/ROMS/ROMS3.0 and compile
 to get ChesROMS_3_3_serial.exe  and issue:

       $CHESROMS_BIN/ChesROMS_3_0_serial.exe < chesroms_Nz30.in
